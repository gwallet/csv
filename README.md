Limitations
-----------

Follow the [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) by default.
Further release may allow to change default separator character, in order to use a semi colon as an example.

In order to operate as fast as possible, the current implementation limits to 256 the number for fields that can be handled in the source stream.
Further release may be more flexible and self scales to the number of columns in the source stream.
